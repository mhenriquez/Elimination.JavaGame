# Elimination.JavaGame
A Java Game using layout managers and Swing GUI components.

The purpose of this assignment is to create an application using layout managers, Swing graphical user interface components, dialogs and optionally graphics. You will create an application to play the game of Elimination. The goal of this game is to gain a low score. You will "roll" two dice and use the numbers on the dice or the sum of the dice to eliminate a list of numbers from one to twelve. You decrease your score by the specific numbers you eliminated.

You always start with a score of 78 which is the sum of the numbers from one to twelve. As an example, on your first roll of the dice you roll a five and a two. You may "eliminate" the number five and the number two or you may eliminate the number seven. Either way your score decreases by seven. You must eliminate the sum of the dice if you roll doubles. That is, if you roll a three and a three, you must eliminate six.

You cannot eliminate the same number more than once per game. The game ends when you roll the dice and cannot eliminate any numbers. Your final game score is the sum of all the numbers you have not eliminated.
